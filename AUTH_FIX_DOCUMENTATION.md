# Authentication System Fix - Password Reset & Session Management

## Problem Summary
The application was experiencing two main issues:
1. **Password Reset Failing**: `column "used" of relation "password_reset_codes" does not exist`
2. **Session Management**: User name not showing after login, no logout option visible

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Database Tables**: The authentication system tables (`password_reset_codes`, `registered_users`) were not created in the database
2. **Inconsistent Insert Operation**: The `createPasswordResetCode` function wasn't explicitly setting the `used` field

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Fix
Created the missing authentication tables with proper schema:

#### Tables Created:
- **`registered_users`**: Stores user accounts with encrypted passwords
- **`password_reset_codes`**: Stores temporary reset codes with expiration and usage tracking
- **`contact_messages`**: Stores contact form submissions
- **`whatsapp_sessions`**: Stores WhatsApp chatbot session data

#### Key Features:
- Proper constraints and indexes
- Default values for boolean fields
- Timestamp tracking for security
- Unique constraints where needed

### 2. Code Fixes
**File**: `server/storage.ts`
- Fixed `createPasswordResetCode` function to explicitly set `used: false`
- This ensures compatibility even if database defaults aren't working

### 3. Migration Scripts
Created two migration options:

#### Option 1: Automated Migration (Recommended)
```bash
npm run migrate:auth
```

#### Option 2: Manual SQL Script
Execute `fix-auth-schema.sql` in your Neon Database console

## How to Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Update Database Schema
Choose one of these methods:

**Method A: Use the automated migration script**
```bash
# Set your database URL
export DATABASE_URL="your_neon_database_url"

# Run the migration
npm run migrate:auth
```

**Method B: Run the SQL script manually**
1. Open your Neon Database console
2. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-auth-schema.sql`
3. Execute the script

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes
The code changes are already applied:
- Fixed storage function to handle `used` column properly
- Session management should work correctly once database is fixed

### Step 3: Test the Functionality
1. **Test Registration**:
   - Go to `/register`
   - Complete the form
   - Should succeed without errors

2. **Test Login**:
   - Log in with valid credentials
   - User name should appear in UI
   - Logout option should be visible

3. **Test Password Reset**:
   - Go to `/login` â†’ "Â¿Olvidaste tu contraseÃ±a?"
   - Enter email address
   - Should receive 6-digit code via email
   - Should be able to reset password

## Files Modified
- âœ… `server/storage.ts` - Fixed `createPasswordResetCode` function
- âœ… `migrate-auth-tables.js` - Automated migration script
- âœ… `fix-auth-schema.sql` - Manual SQL migration script
- âœ… `package.json` - Added `migrate:auth` script

## Expected Results After Fix
1. âœ… Password reset emails will be generated successfully
2. âœ… User names will appear after login
3. âœ… Logout functionality will work properly
4. âœ… No more database column errors in logs
5. âœ… Complete authentication flow working end-to-end

## Security Features Included
- Password reset codes expire after 15 minutes
- Codes are single-use (marked as `used` after consumption)
- Email addresses are case-insensitive and normalized
- Proper password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Session-based authentication with server-side storage

## Verification Commands
After applying the fix, these logs should appear:
```
âœ… Email service initialized successfully

GET /api/auth/check -> 200
POST /api/forgot-password -> 200
POST /api/login -> 200
```

No more `NeonDbError: column "used" does not exist` errors should appear.
